2. **Key Questions**:
   - What are the most common data preparation tasks you perform in your taphonomic research?
   - What specific functionalities would you like to see in a taphonomy-focused R package?
   - Are there any existing tools or scripts you use that could be adapted or improved for the TaphonomyR package?
   - (Would you be willing to contribute code or data to the TaphonomyR project? If so, in what capacity?)
   - Please provide details of any raw, published data you could contribute to the project, including its relevance and potential applications within the package.

### Data Collection and Integration

1. **Data Specifications**: Clear outline of the format and structure required for data submission, using the example provided for the collection of skeletal data. 

2. **Data Usage Agreement**: TBD

3. **Integration and Testing**:
